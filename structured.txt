Assignments for Feb 10

I found a website from OrgSync that listed all of the student organizations at the University. I think we could take this data and find commonalities. There are so many clubs that some are even redundant. I could highlight which clubs do similar things and have the same missions. This could inspire people to merge groups and combine motives.  I think it would be useful because a lot of groups are doing similar things on campus. There are 77 service groups on campus, which means that there must be some kind of overlap. If these groups could come together they would be able to work for the greater good. I would want to present the data by highlighting all of the similar groups and showing the outliers in some form of chart. I could also make a map of campus and place dots on the areas where the organization pertains to on campus.
